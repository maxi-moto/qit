     qit (quick git) a collection of aliases and functions for git.


qit is an every growing collection of git commands that I use regularly.

#### This is still a work in progess!

There are still a ton of things I want to add to qit.

There's something in one of the directories called dev.txt.notes -- it's some
ramblings about what I think might be nice to add. And eventually, there will be
some docs. And maybe a better readme.

#### What it does

It aims to do everything git can do.

#### But why?
I didn't want to have to type git before everythiing anymore. And with certain
things, like clone, I dind't want to have to type extra commands. I wanted to
streamline things.
