      qit (quick git) a collection of aliases and functions for git.

For a complete list of commands and their optional flags, please visit the qit
documentation page.

Here are some common commands that might be useful:

qclone:   Like git, it takes a url and an optional directory. The difference is
          that qclone will also change directories to the cloned repository.

qinit:    Creates a new git repo. qinit also takes two optional paramters:
          --ignore, and --add. See docs.

qcommit:  Use qcommit to commit changes. See docs to set up a standard commit
          message per repo or globally.

qignore:  A command added by qit, it appends file names to .gitignore.
